UI for movies collection on ext. USB drive

If you have some ext. USB drive with movies, like avi/mp4/mkv or maybe iso (video DVD image)
and you need to simplify access to that library,
movieshell can help.

It's a Python program with UI based on Tkinter.
For playing movies, two options supported:

* [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
* [Media Player Classic](http://mpc-hc.org/downloads/)

For watch a movie, all you need is plug-in your ext. USB drive to computer,
start the movieshell (if autorun didn't do it) and
click on button with movie name on it.
If you click on button holding CTRL, movie will be started in alternate player.
